h2. Simple AdHoc Network Simulator

While looking around the net, I found this very simple and nice Simulator for experimenting with AdHoc Networks.
It appears it was originally developed by the **ETH Zurich Distributed Computing** group around 2002. You can read more about it
in 'doc/san.pdf'

It provides a nice GUI and the ability to write you network code as you would normally without any reference to the
Emulator.

h3. Requirements

* Java
* Ant (optional)

h3. Getting Started

1. Build the source via Ant: "ant jar"

2. Double click on the jar to start the apps
